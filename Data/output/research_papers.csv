Impacts of simultaneous operating faults on cooling performance of a high efficiency residential heat pump.pdf,Impacts of simultaneous operating faults on cooling performance of a high efficiency residential heat pump,Yifeng Hu,"Energy & Buildings, 242 (2021) 110975. doi:10.1016/j.enbuild.2021.110975",Elsevier,2021,"The study investigates the impact of simultaneous operating faults on the cooling performance of a high-efficiency residential heat pump system. The analysis shows that COP reductions up to 34% can occur within operation safety limits, highlighting the need for consideration of combined fault impacts in system design and operation.","Experimental testing was conducted using a walk-in cooler and freezer with R22 and R404A refrigerants, respectively. The study presents laboratory results for combinations of single, double, triple, and quadruple faults, including refrigerant charge, evaporator airflow, non-condensable gas, and liquid line restrictions.",[],classification,unsupervised learning,Not mentioned,"The study shows that quadruple faults can reduce capacity by up to 38% and COP by up to 34%, while still allowing the system to run within its safety limits.","The main conclusion is that the superposition principle is not suitable for characterizing fault impacts, and that consideration of combined fault impacts is necessary in system design and operation.",no,Future work includes investigating the impact of faults on other types of air conditioning systems and developing more accurate diagnostic methods.
Multiple simultaneous faults’ impacts on air-conditioner behavior and performance of a charge diagnostic method.pdf,Multiple simultaneous faults’ impacts on air-conditioner behavior and performance of a charge diagnostic method,Yifeng Hu,"Applied Thermal Engineering, 215 (2022) 119015. doi:10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2022.119015",Elsevier,2023,"The paper investigates the impact of simultaneous faults on the performance of a split system air conditioner, focusing on refrigerant charge, evaporator airflow, non-condensable gas, and liquid line restrictions. The study shows that these faults can reduce capacity by up to 42% and efficiency by up to 39%. A method is proposed to evaluate the impact of triple simultaneous faults on cooling capacity and a heat pump system.","The study uses an experimental setup involving an evaporator, compressor, condenser, and mass flow meter. Faults are imposed by adding or removing refrigerant for CH faults, while LL faults use valves V1 and V2 to control pressure drop across the liquid line. The test matrix includes 98 possible combinations of faults and intensities.","['Support Vector Machines', 'Virtual Sensors', 'Artificial Intelligence']",classification,supervised learning,Not mentioned,The study shows that simultaneous faults can reduce capacity by up to 42% and efficiency by up to 39%. The VRC performance with multiple fault combinations shows varying degrees of degradation in COP for heat pumps and air conditioners.,"The paper concludes that considering multiple features simultaneously is important in fault diagnostics for air conditioning systems. It highlights the limitations of relying solely on superheat or subcooling and emphasizes the need for more comprehensive approaches, such as the VRC method.",no,"More experimental data is needed to understand the generality of the findings, which would aid in developing advanced fault diagnostics and improving installation methods."
A figure of merit for overall performance and value of AFDD.pdf,A figure of merit for overall performance and value of AFDD tools,David P. Yuill,"International Journal of Refrigeration, 74 (2016) 649-659. doi:10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2016.11.015",Elsevier,2017,"The paper presents a figure of merit, V, to evaluate the performance of Air-Conditioning Diagnostics and Diagnostic (AFDD) maintenance tools. The calculation considers probability, tool response, and implications, yielding a typical average value for deploying the AFDD tool compared to maintenance without it. Case studies evaluate six real tools and two idealized ones, showing five with negative V, indicating harm rather than benefit, while one shows approximately $10 benefit per nominal ton of air-conditioner capacity per visit.","The methodology involves calculating a figure of merit (V) using probabilities of outdoor temperature and fault occurrence, assuming routine maintenance without AFDD. The value is determined by comparing it to a baseline scenario where the technician performs maintenance but does not apply AFDD or diagnostic measurements.",['Q FDD tool'],classification,unsupervised learning,Not mentioned,"The results show that AFDD can provide substantial benefits or impose substantial costs, on the order of $10 ton for a typical maintenance visit. The case studies demonstrate the FOM methodology, showing potential monetary value from current AFDD tools in maintenance service.","The main conclusion is that AFDD protocols can have significant economic impacts, with some providing substantial benefits and others imposing substantial costs. The paper's contribution is the development of a figure of merit (V) to evaluate AFDD performance and the demonstration of its application using case studies.",no,"Future work includes improving AFDD techniques to reduce False Alarms and Misdiagnoses, which would increase the economic values per unit of rated cooling capacity added. Additionally, validation and evaluation of fault detection and diagnostics tools for vapor compression systems using simulation results from multiple systems is recommended."

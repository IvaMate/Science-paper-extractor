"2019., Chaobo Zhang, An improved association rule mining-based method for revealing operational problems of building heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.pdf","An improved association rule mining-based method for revealing operational problems of building heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems",Chaobo Zhang,"Applied Energy, 253 (2019) 113492. doi:10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113492",Elsevier,2019,"The paper proposes an improved association rule mining-based method for discovering operational problems in building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. The method uses kernel density estimation for data preprocessing and a novel comparison-based approach for post-mining. The study evaluates a commercial building's chiller plant in Shenzhen, China, using one-year historical data from May 2016 to May 2017.","The methodology involves three parts: data preprocessing, association rule mining, and association rule comparison-based post-mining. Data preprocessing includes missing value handling, invalid measurement deleting, outlier identification, and data transformation. Association rule mining discovers raw rules presenting variable relationships. Post mining extracts most relevant rules revealing operational problems through grouping, normalization, comparison, and expert analysis.","Future work could involve applying the proposed method to other building energy systems, occupant behaviors, and appliance consumption patterns. Additionally, exploring the impact of ambient air pollution on ventilation in China and improving building energy efficiency through operations and data mining techniques."

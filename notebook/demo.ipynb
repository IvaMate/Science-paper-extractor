Fan coil units (FCUs) play a critical role in providing comfort in various environments as an important component of HVAC systems. However, FCUs often experience failures that affect their efficiency and increase their energy consumption. In this context, deep learning (DL)-based fault detection offers a promising solution. By detecting faults early and preventing system failures, the efficiency of FCUs can be improved. This paper explores DL models as fault detectors for FCUs to enable smarter and more energy-efficient hotel buildings. We tested three contemporary DL modeling approaches: convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory network (LSTM), and a combination of CNN and gated recurrent unit (GRU). The random forest model (RF) was additionally developed as a baseline benchmark. The fault detectors were tested on a real-world dataset obtained from the sensory measurement system installed in a hotel and additionally supplemented with simulated data via a physical model developed in TRNSYS. Three representative FCU faults, namely, a stuck valve, a reduction in airflow, and an FCU outage, were simulated with a much larger dataset than is typically utilized in similar studies. The results showed that the hybrid model, integrating CNN and GRU, performed best for all three observed faults. DL-based fault detectors outperformed the baseline RF model, confirming these solutions as viable components for energy-efficient hotels.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The stable operation of air handling units (AHU) is critical to ensure high efficiency and to extend the lifetime of the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems of buildings. In this paper, an online data-driven diagnosis method for AHU in an HVAC system is proposed and elaborated. The rule-based method can roughly detect the sensor condition by setting threshold values according to prior experience. Then, an efficient feature selection method using 1D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed for fault diagnosis of AHU in HVAC systems according to the system’s historical data obtained from the building management system. The new framework combines the rule-based method and CNNs-based method (RACNN) for sensor fault and complicated fault. The fault type of AHU can be accurately identified via the offline test results with an accuracy of 99.15% and fast online detection within 2 min. In the lab, the proposed RACNN method was validated on a real AHU system. The experimental results show that the proposed RACNN improves the performance of fault diagnosis.</td>\n",

The method also uses rule-based diagnosis techniques to determine fault detection thresholds.</td>\n",

       "4   Optimizing the performance of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems is critical in today's energy-conscious world. Fan coil units (FCUs) play a critical role in providing comfort in various environments as an important component of HVAC systems. However, FCUs often experience failures that affect their efficiency and increase their energy consumption. In this context, deep learning (DL)-based fault detection offers a promising solution. By detecting faults early and preventing system failures, the efficiency of FCUs can be improved. This paper explores DL models as fault detectors for FCUs to enable smarter and more energy-efficient hotel buildings. We tested three contemporary DL modeling approaches: convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory network (LSTM), and a combination of CNN and gated recurrent unit (GRU). The random forest model (RF) was additionally developed as a baseline benchmark. The fault detectors were tested on a real-world dataset obtained from the sensory measurement system installed in a hotel and additionally supplemented with simulated data via a physical model developed in TRNSYS. Three representative FCU faults, namely, a stuck valve, a reduction in airflow, and an FCU outage, were simulated with a much larger dataset than is typically utilized in similar studies. The results showed that the hybrid model, integrating CNN and GRU, performed best for all three observed faults. DL-based fault detectors outperformed the baseline RF model, confirming these solutions as viable components for energy-efficient hotels.   \n",

Due to the complexity of the building management system (BMS) with operational data input from a large number of sensors used in HVAC system, the faults can be very difficult to detect in the early stage. While numerous fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) methods with the use of statistical modeling and machine learning have revealed prominent results in recent years, early detection remains a challenging task since many current approaches are unfeasible for diagnosing some HVAC faults and have accuracy performance issues. In view of this, this study presents a novel hybrid FDD approach by combining random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for the application of FDD for the HVAC system. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed hybrid random forest–support vector machine (HRF–SVM) outperforms other methods with higher prediction accuracy (98%), despite that the fault symptoms were insignificant. Furthermore, the proposed framework can reduce the significant number of sensors required and work well with the small number of faulty training data samples available in real-world applications.   \n",

In this paper, an online data-driven diagnosis method for AHU in an HVAC system is proposed and elaborated. The rule-based method can roughly detect the sensor condition by setting threshold values according to prior experience. Then, an efficient feature selection method using 1D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed for fault diagnosis of AHU in HVAC systems according to the system’s historical data obtained from the building management system. The new framework combines the rule-based method and CNNs-based method (RACNN) for sensor fault and complicated fault. The fault type of AHU can be accurately identified via the offline test results with an accuracy of 99.15% and fast online detection within 2 min. In the lab, the proposed RACNN method was validated on a real AHU system. The experimental results show that the proposed RACNN improves the performance of fault diagnosis.   \n",
